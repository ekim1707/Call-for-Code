# Call-for-Code

This repo is intended to be for the CRA frontend.
Front End and Back End Choices:

Front End: The main benefit for using Create-React-App for the front-end is that it’s a SPA, which places much of the load on the client-side instead of the server-side. There’s many benefits of this, specifically relating to performance and speed. By controlling the front-end through rendering, React reduces the need for the front-end to constantly ping the back-end and refresh through each user event. Since in general, personal computers and laptops are high-performing these days anyway, transferring the load towards the client-side makes everything easier, and client computers and laptops are more than capable of handling it.
