# Call-for-Code

This repo is intended to be for the CRA frontend.
Front End and Back End Choices:

# Benefits

 The main benefit for using Create-React-App for the front-end is that it’s a SPA, which places much of the load on the client-side instead of the server-side. There’s many benefits of this, specifically relating to performance and speed. By controlling the front-end through rendering, React reduces the need for the front-end to constantly ping the back-end and refresh through each user event. Since in general, personal computers and laptops are high-performing these days anyway, transferring the load towards the client-side makes everything easier, and client computers and laptops are more than capable of handling it.

The Team:



Diego Mejia: Frontend and Backend developer. 
Eugene Kim: Frontend developer.
Glei Dantas: Design, ideation, research and project management.


How we worked:



Sharing the tasks, getting it done and offering to all the members a chance to review and give their personal inputs to improve the quality of the work and supply our own deficiencies.  This was the way chosen to coordinate the project. Everyone has a voice, a piece on it and high motivation to help those who need.


Next Steps & Future:




Get early feedback on the prototype with the first responders interviewed.

Revisit the organizations in the city of San Diego that I (Glei) visited when I was researching about stress at the workplace to show the prototype.

Seek patnerships for the content creation.

Recruit psychologist for the team.

Improve UI/UX.

Organize the videos on the De-stress feature into situational categories ( e.g: Morning routines, lunch walk sound tracks, positive mindset setup ( can be used before shifts so that the medical staff can prepare themselves better for the suffering they will see) and etc.

Finish the Self-Care feature * Key differentiation.

Make a landing page.

Work on a mobile version and integrate w/ wearables to detect stress levels.

Final Goal is written on the Project roadmap.
